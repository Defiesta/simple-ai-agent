# Simple AI Agent

A verifiable AI trading signal generator for DeFi using RISC Zero and Boundless Network. The system generates ETH price predictions using linear regression and creates trading signals (BUY/SELL) with verifiable zero-knowledge proofs.

## Overview

The AI agent analyzes historical ETH price data using linear regression to predict future prices and generate trading signals. All computation is verifiable through zero-knowledge proofs generated by RISC Zero and processed via the Boundless Network.

## Quick Start

1. Install RISC Zero:
   ```sh
   curl -L https://risczero.com/install | bash
   rzup install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables using the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

3. Run with the full production configuration:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --bin app -- --current-price 3200
   ```

   or Run the trading signal system:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --bin app
   ```
## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Guest Program**: Rust program that performs linear regression on ETH price history
- **Smart Contract**: TradingSignal contract deployed on Base mainnet that verifies proofs and stores signals
- **Client**: Application that orchestrates proof generation and contract interaction

## Configuration

The system is configured for Ethereum Sepolia testnet with the following deployed contract:
- TradingSignal: `T0x1B4274Fea65a7131A0Ccd538b780b239dFB35B60`

## Development

Build the project:
```bash
forge build && cargo build
```

Test:
```bash
forge test && cargo test
```
